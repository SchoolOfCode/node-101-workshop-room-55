  /*ðŸ‘‰ 2c. Create a function called `describeItem`, which should take in an item as a parameter 
  (the argument handed to this function would be an item from our collection). 
  The function should `console.log` a message according to how many of the item you have.

If there's only one of the item in your collection, it should log "I have a `name`. 
Here's what I like about it: `whatILike`". If you have more than one of it, 
the message should log "I have `count` `name`s. Here's what I like about them: `whatILike`".

Plan
Write an if statement so if count = 1 print out myName and what I like
but if count = 2 print out count, myName and what I like

For example, the result of calling the `describeItem` function with the first item in our collection would be:
_"I have a School of Code mug. Here's what I like about it: It has my cute pixel character on it!"_

Call your function below where you've defined it, handing in the first item in `myCollection`.

Now run the file again (using `node index.js`); */

  
/*ðŸ‘‰ 2d. Now make a function called `describeCollection` 
that takes in an array as a parameter. 
The function should loop through the array, and for each item, 
it should call the `describeItem` function so it displays a message 
according to how many you have in your collection.

Plan
Write a for loop to go through each index in the array in myCollection

Call your function below where you've defined it, handing in the `myCollection` array.

Run the file again to see the output and check that it outputs the correct message 
for each item in your collection (i.e. each object in your `myCollection` array). */


/*function describeCollection() {

  for (let i = 0; i < myCollection.length; i++)

  let myName = myCollection[i].name
  let count = myCollection[i].count
  let like = myCollection[i].whatILike
  if (count === 1) {

/*## Part 3: Exporting and importing

Now let's neaten things up by moving the `myCollection` array to its own file. 
With Node's power to export and import, everything doesn't have to all be in one file, 
which makes for cleaner, more readable code.

ðŸ‘‰ 3a. Create a new file in the same folder called `collection.js`. 
Cut and paste your `myCollection` array from `index.js` to collection.js instead.

_Note: Only move the `myCollection` variable! Keep the functions in `index.js`._ */




import myCollection from "./collection.js"; 
console.log(myCollection)



/*ðŸ‘‰ 3c. Now import `myCollection` at the top of `index.js`. You should be able to then call your function 
just as you did in part 1, but this time using `myCollection` imported from its separate file.

Use Node to run the `index.js` file again just to check that your console.logs are still 
coming through correctly! */
